# latinAr
An extensive dataset for latin-written arabic.

# What is latin-written Arabic?
Latin-written Arabic is any text written in latin alphabet, mainly english and french, but which represents arabic words. Here are some examples:

# Examples 
The word "إذهب" is arabic for "Go" in English. And because most arabic-speaking countries don't use arabic keyboards for chatting, short and even long text messaging, it is written "Idhab" (Frenchly-pronounced) or "Edheb" (Englishly-prnonouced). The ultimate goal behind this repo is to provide a latinAR-to-Classical-arabic mapping, so for the word "إذهب", we'll have the following mapping: <b>{Idhab: إذهب}</b>. 

# The Goal
We aim with this repository to provide an as-extensive-as-possible dataset for latin written arabic, hence the name "latinAr". Specifically regions such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, but also Egypt, Mauritania, Lybia and eventually more depending on adoption and need.

This repository is structured into regions (i.e. a batch of countries having roughly the same language aspects), countries (i.e. Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and then country regions (i.e. northern, eastern etc... depending language differences in the same country).
Thus, the repo is structured as follows: Dataset/Regions/Countries/Country-regions/data-types.
The data-type part of the repo structures data into words, phrases and sentences, paragraphs, then long texts.

# But why launch a latinAr dataset?!
Well, because being a <b>deep learning driven team of individuals</b>, and after being disappointed that there's a huge lack in structured latinAr data, we've realized that we could not perform anything deep learning-related for the modern arabic language! <b>So we've decided to create one. For the sake of AI-democratization</b>.
