# latinAr
An extensive dataset for latin-written arabic.

We aim with this repository to provide an "as extensive as possible" dataset for latin written arabic, hence "latinAr". Specifically regions such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, but also Egypt, Mouritania, Lybia and eventually more depending on adoption and need.
